## Timezones

```{r, echo=FALSE}
suppressMessages(library(rgdal))
#tz = readOGR("world/","tz_world_mp",verbose=FALSE)
nr = ogrInfo("world/",layer = "tz_world_mp")$nrows
```

Working with time zones can be incredibly difficult, there are currently something around `r nr` distinct timezones around the globe. A current database of the spatial extents of these regions is maintained at http://efele.net/maps/tz/world/. These data are available as a shapefile (more on these next week) which contains the polygons / multipolygons that make up these `r nr` regions.

Due to the complexity of these polygons it takes an annoyingly long time to plot a world map everytime we need to knit this document, so instead we will write separate code to generate a separate plot which we will include as an image in this document.

## Simulations

Another example of a time consuming process that we probably do not want to include directly in our document is a simulation. Here we will attempt to use monte carlo methods to estimate the value of $\pi$.

We perform this simulation by sampling $x_i,y_i \sim Unif(0,1)$ repeatedly and calculating 

$$d_i = \sqrt{x_i^2+y_i^2}$$

the ratio of $d_i$s less than 1 should be equal to $\pi/4$, hence we can estimate $\pi$ as 4 times this ratio. The plot below shows the result of the first 100 draws, points within 1 of the origin are denoted in green.

</div>

```{r, echo=FALSE}
load(file="sim/sim_tab_results.Rdata")
options(scipen=100, digits=10)
```

We can evaluate the convergence of our simulation by examining the performance at various points along the `r tab[nrow(tab),1]` steps of our simulation.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
knitr::kable(tab, align="c")
```
